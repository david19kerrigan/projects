From the sorting excel table which was produced with a single run of the Reporting1 file and
formatting into a table.  The fastest method for small and long arrays both sorted and 
reversed was quicksort.  HeapSort and MergeSort were of comparitive speeds for a sorted array
but for a reversed array MergeSort was quicker than HeapSort, but not as quick as QuickSort.
Based on the mean and variance values, HeapSort was by far the quickest for small random arrays, followed by 
quicksort and mergesort.  For large arrays, Quicksort showed the quickest sorting time.

For random arrays the variation was huge which means the sorting times varied greatly since each array
was completely random.  Sorting with lower mean and lower variance means more efficiency and vice 
versa.
